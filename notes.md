# What is TypeScript?

* Developed by Microsoft and Released in October 2012
* Superset of JavaScript
* Known for imposing strict typing in JavaScript
* All TS code transpiles into JS code for the browser
* ECMASCript support TypeScript was formalized in 2015.
* Version 5.0.4 is now availble
* typescriptlang.org is the main source of documentation for TS

# Introduction to TypeScript
## Features

# Advantages of using Typescript
* With a good IDE you can capture certain errors at compile time before they run time level
* Support for static typing (string typing)
* TypeScript, once trans-piled down to JS can runs on any browser or JavaScript engine like NodeJS
* Using a good IDE, the developer can have IntelliSense with TypeScript
* Namespaces if used properly can be a great tool for modular development.

# TypeScript Types
* Primitve (built-in types based on JavaScript)
* User-defined types (basucally objects)
* Any type
* Others are unknown, tuple, array, union, interface and null
* never

# TypeScript Generics
* Genrics is somewhat related to concepts like lazy loading, polymorphism and abstract classes and functions.
* There is a time component involved.
* It makes code more flexible, reusable and may even lessen duplication of code.
* TS Generics improve Type safety.
* Genertics can be used wherever passing a parameter is involved.
